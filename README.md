This is a simple tool that visualises tablebase endgame outcomes, written mostly to study pawn endgames and opposition. It uses [lichess tablebase api](http://tablebase.lichess.ovh/standard?fen=4k3/6KP/8/8/8/8/7p/8_w_-_-_0_1) to fetch the results.

## Getting Started

The code is written with Next.js framework. First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
